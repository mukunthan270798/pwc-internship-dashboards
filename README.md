You can find some of the dashboards I created during PWC PowerBI Virtual Case Experience

Each dashboard elucidates a business problem statement and the report will assist in deriving valuable insights from the underlying data.
Further, it aids us to provide suggestions and solutions to the business problems.

Below are the dashboard's business statements:
1. Analyse and make a report on the call patterns and trends of a call center agency.
2. Prepare a report to study the churn rate of a company. Define KPIs to measure and investigate the churn rate patterns and influential factors affecting churn rate.
3. Create a dashboard that provides insights into the workforce diversity and inclusion of an organization.
