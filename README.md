You can find some of the dashboards I created in PWC PowerBI Virtual Case Experience

Each dashboard elucidate a business problem statement and the report will assist in deriving valuable insights from the underlying data
and aid us to provide suggestions and solution to the business problems

Below are the dashboard's business statements:
1. Analyse and make a report on the call patterns and trends of a call center agency.
2. Prepare a report to study the churn rate of a company. Define KPIs to measure and investigate into the churn rate patterns and influential factors affecting churn rate.
3. Create a dashboard that provides insights into the workforce diversity of an organization.
